**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Skill Swap Platform: Bridging the Gap in Skill Exchange**

Many individuals possess valuable skills (e.g., coding, graphic design, cooking) and a desire to learn new ones. However, accessible and free avenues for skill exchange or trading are limited, often requiring financial investment or formal classes.

The Skill Swap Platform addresses this by providing a dedicated space for users to list their teachable and desired skills. This platform facilitates connections, allowing users to

- **Find Matching Users**

Discover individuals with complementary skills, creating opportunities for mutually beneficial learning.

- **Send Swap Requests**

Initiate skill exchange requests to formally propose a learning arrangement.

- **Trade skills directly**

Exchange knowledge and expertise without requiring monetary transactions or formal institutions.

This platform offers a free and collaborative environment, fostering a culture of mutual learning and empowerment within the community
